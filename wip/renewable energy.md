Conflicting interests -> Economic vs environmental

Conflicting politics -> Local vs Global (nuclear vs coal)

These are the design criteria

#### Some solutions
Cheap enough energy = carbon capture (Akarsh)
Processing of nuclear waste (could reduce environmental impact, less waste )

Nuclear waste storage has to have a minimal economic effect, while providing a big boost to the economy. Ideally, people should be fighting for their town to have a nuclear storage site.


Start at the end:
Once we have *infinite* energy, we will carbon capture for a really low cost, because there will be some small incentive to do so. 

But, how to we get to infinite energy?:
The only real options:
- Solar
- Nuclear
- Coal / Natural Gas

Let's rule out coal and natural gas right away. Doubling production of this would be insane from the start, as nobody would buy into it (we need something that's economically *and* environmentally feasable).

#### Canada carbon tax
**32 billion** over the past 5 years.

1.6 dollars per watt for a solar panel

The carbon tax revenue could supply 20 billion watts of power to canadians
Or 20 GW

550 billion kwh / yr
this is about 62.7 million kw
or 62.7 billion watts.

The carbon tax over 5 years (invested into solar) could have bought 1/3 of the Canadian energy infrastructure needs.

But, this isn't happening because people don't like their tax dollars going towards solar. At the end of the day, this is still government intervention.

So, how do we increase energy production drastically, without government intervention?

Nuclear, or solar? (oil is already at a capatilist economic boom, we don't need to encourage that any more.)

However, this disregards a big portion of this - land. The land for solar farms is quite large. Instead, maybe there could be a business model in which a company decides to loan out property (on top of buildings, whatever, for some of the price, and in return the solar company installs them for free, while keeping some of the energy profit.). This would be a really good way to offset the cost.

A government solution isn't a good one, because it will ALWAYS artificially increase prices in the economy. This is clear through carbon taxes, through rebates (giving people money for solar is increasing people's taxes), and any other program. They all have a negative impact on the economy, which is why "conservatives" don't like it.
#### Nuclear drawbacks (besides the economy)
Could be used for terrorism / international threats, (don't need a nuclear bomb to cause fallout)
